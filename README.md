# Flipkart_Flash_Sale


Overview:

In a flash sale, the products are available for a very short period of time and we often run out of time filling out the basic credentials like username, password etc. So, this program saves us from doing the labour and automatically fill up all the details using selenium

#NOTE: this program is designed for sale in flipkart.com

Steps to run:

1. In the b.get command enter the url of the product you want to buy in flipkart

2. In the username send_keys part of the code enter your flipkart username

3. In the password send_keys part of the code enter your account password

4. Finally manually type the captcha and hit buy now....


Basic Expaination:

Selenium library of python helps us to automatically navigate throught the web and can also click button enter credentials in the boxes.Using selenium we first navigated to the desired website and filled out the required feilds. We inspected the elements and found out the classes and Id's(which don't change for different product in the website) of the feild and feeded them in the code

I tested the code on June 14th 2017 and was successfull to purchase a Redimi Note 4 which gets sold out very quickly.
